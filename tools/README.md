# Repository Tools

This folder contains tools that are used by the website to update it's content.
The tools are mainly written in `Rust` as I am most comfortable in that 
language _(at the time of writing)_ as using `Rust` doesn't give any advantage
since these are just basic tools that are dependent on API(s).
